# What
what-title=What pontoons?
what-desc=Pontoon allows you to localise web content in place, with context and spatial limitations right in front of you.
context-desc=By localising web page on the page itself, you no longer need to worry if the word you are translating is a verb or noun.
space=See spatial limitations
space-desc=Avoid breaking user interface by seeing how much space is available for your translations, which is especially useful with apps.
preview=Get instant preview
preview-desc=The moment you submit a translation, it replaces the original text in the web page, making you the first proof-reader and tester.

# How
how-desc=Pontoon is a very simple and intuitive tool that requires little to no technical skill for localisers to use.
hover-desc=Move your mouse over headings, links, paragraphs or other text blocks on this page. A dashed rectangle will appear around each of these blocks, marking strings that are available for localisation on the page itself.
