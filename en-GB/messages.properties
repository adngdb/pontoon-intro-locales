# What
what-desc=Pontoon allows you to localise web content in place, with context and spatial limitations right in front of you.
context-desc=By localising web page on the page itself, you no longer need to worry if the word you are translating is a verb or noun.

# How
how-desc=Pontoon is a very simple and intuitive tool that requires little to no technical skill for localisers to use.
hover-desc=Move your mouse over headings, links, paragraphs or other text blocks on this page. A dashed rectangle will appear around each of these blocks, marking strings that are available for localisation on the page itself.
